# Yesod Taxes 

A tutorial for building a first web app in Haskell with Yesod, Persistent/Postrgres, and Nix Flakes.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and move into the created directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rcannon/yesod-taxes.git
$ cd yesod-taxes
```

2. Confirm that Nix Flakes are enabled. 
Enter the development environment (necessary for loading Postgres through nix):
```
$ nix develop
```

3. Activate the Postgres Database:
```
$ ./db_start.sh
```
- Note: to stop the database and remove the stored database files, run `./db_stop.sh`.

4. Run the application:
```
$ nix run
```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:3000/`.

6. Follow the instructions on the site!

## Tutorial

### Goals and Project Structure 

The goal of this tutorial is to help you get started with developing Haskell web applications with Yesod. While I think the [Yesod Book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book) is well written, it can be quite daunting for people who are new to Haskell or new to Yesod. Here I will give you an introduction to Yesod by building a simple United States federal income tax calclator.

We will be managing the development environment with Nix through Flakes and with Cabal with the `callCabal2nix`. I'm not going to talk much about setting this up, but you can take a look at the `Flake.nix` file if you are interested. When I started using Nix Flakes, I found [this](https://serokell.io/blog/practical-nix-flakes) post from Serokell immensly helpful (in fact, the `Flake.nix` file for this project based on and nearly identical to the final one shown in the above post). 

To keep things simple, the whole application is kept in a single file: `app/Main.hs`. 

### Backend Computation

To keep things simple, we are going to base the whole tax calculation on "income." Here is the Haskell code we will use for representing income:

```Haskell
-- lines 33-36 of Main.hs
-- info from user
data TaxInfo = TaxInfo 
  { incomeInfo :: Double }
  deriving Show
```

We are going to return a couple results to the user (and store them in a database, but that comes later): tax payed in USD, after-tax income in USD, and effective tax rate as a decimal between 0 and 1. The effective tax rate is just the tax payed divided by the income before taxes. Here is the code for representing this (Note: this will look a little different than you might expect, since we have to do some extra work to make this data storable in postgres through persistent; we'll talk about the additional stuff later):

```Haskell
-- lines 43 - 51 of Main.hs
-- result to user, which will be 
-- stored in database for later access
share [mkPersist sqlSettings, mkMigrate "migrateAll"] [persistLowerCase|
TaxResult
  taxPayed Double
  afterTaxIncome Double
  effectiveTaxPercent Double
  deriving Show
|]
```
